# Things that make you go hmm...

If there is no "API jar" and the code under the `javax` namespace is an implementation:

 - Should that implementation be allowed to ship under the `jakarta` groupId?

## Market Perception

If one implementation is allowed to ship under the `jakarta` groupId, will the market see
all implementations as equals or will it tend to view one as "the official" implementation?

## Who Bares Responsibility?

If the implementation is part of the official Specification Project, does this mean everyone
who is a committer on the project bares responsibility to maintain, bugfix and release the
implementation code even if they have their own implementation and are there only to help
with the specification and TCK?

## Whose Votes Count?

If the implementation is part of the official Specification Project and maintaining that
implementation requires a sizable team of individuals, do those individuals have equal
 vote on specification and TCK disputes as individuals who are representing external
 implementations?

## Is Representation Balanced?

If all committers of one implementation have vote over specification and TCK disputes, but
 only a portion of committers from other implementations have a vote is that Specification
 Project balanaced enough to deliver on vendor neutrality and portability?

## Tendency to Contribute to the Official Implementation?

If those who hear about the Specification come to the project and find an implementation will
there be a greater tendency for those people to use and contribute to the implementation
maintained by the Specification Project itself?

## Viability of other implementations?

If other implementation must deal with the following challenges:

 - All marketing of the specification is also marketing for the implementation
 - Lack of public awareness there are other implementations
 - Perception of one implementation being "the official" implementation
 - Tendency for the specification project to be dominated by one implementation
 - Difficulty in competing for committers resulting in increasing disparity on all points above over time

Are other implementations viable?

## Vendor neutral?

If other implementation are considered to be viable, is the specification project vendor-neutral?

## Does it meet our requirements?

Do specifications that lack in viability of or neutrality meet our requirements as a specification?

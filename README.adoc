#  Jakarta EE Source Code and Bytecode Analysis

There are actually two different unrelated side projects in this repo.  Excuse the
code and disorganization as the goal was to get one-time answers, not to build
 something that lasted forever.

## Renaming javax classes to jakarta

Everything under `org.eclipse.wg.jakartaee.deps` is attempting to help answer questions about the impact
of renaming `javax` packages to `jakarta`

This code uses Maven Central and Bytecode Analysis.

- walk the `jakarta` groupId in Maven Central
- download each jar and cache it locally
- extract each jar into a temp directory
- parse the bytecode code via ASM
- serialize a json representation of the ASM findings (see `src/main/resources/deps/raw`)
- properly split each class out by logical package (see `src/main/resources/deps/split`)
- analyze dependencies between each package

## Moving API repos to a dedicated `jakartaee` github org

There was a recent conversation in the Working Group on potentially moving specification repos from `eclipse-ee4j` into the https://github.com/jakartaee org so that specifications were separate from implementations.

Everything under `org.eclipse.wg.jakartaee.repos` is attempting to help answer questions about the impact
of that split by analyzing all 107 `eclipse-ee4j` repos.

This code uses Github API and Source Code Analysis

- walk the eclipse-ee4j org in Github via the Github API
- clone each repo via jgit
- parse the source code via JavaParser
- look for `javax` source code
- analyze that code for non-javax imports such as com.sun.*

Analysis results of all 107 repos can be found here:
